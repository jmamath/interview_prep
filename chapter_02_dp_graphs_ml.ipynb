        "**Hint**: For beam search, maintain a beam (priority queue) of sequences sorted by score. At each step, generate all possible next tokens for each sequence in the beam, score the new sequences, and keep only the top-k. Use a heap to efficiently maintain the beam.\n",

        "**Hint**: For top-k sampling, first apply temperature scaling to logits, then select the top-k tokens. For length normalization, divide the total score by sequence length raised to a power. For diversity penalty, calculate similarity between sequences and penalize similar ones.\n",

        "**Hint**: The Viterbi algorithm has two phases: forward pass (calculate probabilities) and backward pass (reconstruct path). Use dynamic programming to store the best path to each state at each time step. For unknown words, use smoothing or assign uniform probability across all tags.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Hint**: Implement constraints as separate classes with `check()` and `can_be_satisfied()` methods. During beam search, filter out sequences that violate constraints and prune branches that can't satisfy constraints. Use early termination when no valid sequences remain.\n",
        "\n",
