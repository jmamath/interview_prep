        "<summary>Click to reveal hint for Question 1: Memory-Efficient Prefix Sum</summary>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint**: For in-place prefix sum, you need to iterate through the array once and update each element to be the sum of all previous elements plus itself. Start from index 1 (since index 0 doesn't need to change) and for each position i, set `arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i]`.\n",
        "\n",

        "<summary>Click to reveal hint for Question 2: Tensor Operation Benchmarking</summary>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint**: For the loop version, use a simple for loop with indexing. For the vectorized version, use NumPy's built-in multiplication operator. Use `time.time()` to measure execution time and `tracemalloc` to track memory usage. Create arrays of different sizes and measure both time and memory for each approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight**: Vectorized operations should be significantly faster due to SIMD instructions and reduced Python overhead.\n",

        "<summary>Click to reveal hint for Question 3: Cache-Aware Matrix Operations</summary>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint**: For tiling, divide the matrices into smaller blocks (tiles) and process them separately. This improves cache locality by keeping frequently accessed data in cache. The tile size should be chosen based on cache size (typically 64x64 or 128x128). For Numba, use the `@jit(nopython=True)` decorator to compile the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight**: Tiling reduces cache misses by ensuring that when you access a tile, all its data fits in cache.\n",

        "<details>\n",
        "<summary>Click to reveal hint for Question 4: Custom Sparse Tensor Operations</summary>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint**: In COO format, store non-zero values and their coordinates separately. For addition, you need to merge the coordinate lists and sum values at the same coordinates. For element-wise multiplication, only multiply values that exist in both tensors. For reshaping, convert 1D coordinates to multi-dimensional coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight**: Sparse operations should only work on non-zero elements, making them much more memory-efficient for sparse data.\n",

        "<summary>Click to reveal hint for Question 5: Memory Profiling and Optimization</summary>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint**: Use `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()` and `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()` for GPU memory tracking. For gradient checkpointing, use `torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint()` to trade compute for memory. Implement the network with multiple large layers and measure memory usage at each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight**: Gradient checkpointing saves memory by recomputing activations during backward pass instead of storing them during forward pass.\n",
